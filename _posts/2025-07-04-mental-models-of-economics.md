title: "I studied economics in some form for years. I can't say I use all of its models well"
summary: "'Economics' is an umbrella term for many theoretical and empirical subjects"
description: "An open accounting of my mental models"

'Economics' is an umbrella term covering several loosely allied theoretical and empirical fields. The concepts and models I use at work and in other parts of life today are a mishmash of all of them. I wish I studied a more precise subject that had a precise name and a specific career trajectory. I feel like I spend a lot of time learning and understanding what I have to do. The fundamentals of economics didn't really prepare me for my professiona life. It seems that the things economics is good for are cutesy freaknonomics stuff

## Concepts I use, in a roughly descending order of amount of economic theory

* Opportunity cost of my choices, realizing I am not always great at it
* The belief that we can observe people are making the most of their choices subject to budget constraints
* Diminishing returns to time/money inputs with respect to (a vague notion of) utility
* Expected value, risk and certainty equivalence
* Principles of causal inference, particularly thinking about confounders and counterfactuals
* Econometric modeling, mostly boiling down to using and interpreting regression models
* Machine learning
* Learning about institutions and data generating processes before using any of the tools
* Data visualization


## Concepts I have never considered and feel insecure when smarter people discuss these around me

* Market design and auctions
* Measuring price elasticties from data


## How do I grow?
