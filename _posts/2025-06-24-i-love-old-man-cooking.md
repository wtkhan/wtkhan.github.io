My favorite subgenre of Food YouTube is Old Man Cooking. I define this genre as a loose bundle of the following traits:

- The recipes are uninvolved and use ingredients that are easily available. The flavors are simple, the food is fatty and filling

- The men who cook them are old, slow to move and comfortable on camera. They convey the impression that they'd talk to a single person standing in their home kitchen in much the same way

- These men are delightful curmudgeons while handling food and cooking. Some good examples of this behavior:
    - Sitting down while cooking, though luckily everything they need is around them
    - Dipping bare fingers into either dishes to taste for seasoning or hot pans to flip food
    - Cutting or chopping stuff on a dinner plate or other surface, just not a board
    - Using tablespoons and forks instead of sensible spatuals or similar to move food around in hot pans

- Cooking these recipes are exercises in slow living. It's a perfect way to be fussy about a single meal for yourself and a patient partner

- Despite the fussiness, there's little to no intellectualizing about the cooking process or the food. No talking about the love of food, culture or nourishing people. No mentions of the Maillard reaction or using pasta water. No reminscing about cooking with a dead relative. It's just fucking cooking in a kitchen. Marco Pierre White natters in places about the restaurant business in the video I link below, but he's also making a slow dish and needs to fill in dead air

- The editing and production value of these videos, like the hosts, are understated

Here are some of my all-time favorite clips and old men, determined by how often I revisit them:

- Antonio Carluccio making [tiramisu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40imxki0xR8) while sitting down. I don't eat pork but I still learned a lot from his [pasta carbonara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AAdKl1UYZs) video

- Marco Pierre White making [scrambled eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSOu3-cymnY) for the BBC while whispering his beautiful nonsense

- Jacques Pépin cooking [pesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahAZyI76ELg) and [onion sandwiches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53zD6i5zGc8)

- James May making British sandwiches from the 70s, like [cold sandwiches with salad cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytbyFzOt320)

- Alain Desgranges making [chocolate mousse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs2prVvabkE "Alain Desgranges making chocolate mousse"). At one point he yoinks the KitchenAid blender at an angle for the overhead camera to get a better shot of the bowl, which is particularly delightful and curmudgeonly.

- Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh making a [ham sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPB6LTWThH4)

- Ainsley Harriot makes a [toasted sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1_ODDevbY8) in Jamaica

You may notice that some of these videos trigger ASMR. In fact, the last two sandwich videos often come up in 'unintentional ASMR' playlists. I'll leave my
