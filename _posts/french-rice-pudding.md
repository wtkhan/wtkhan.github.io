Before discovering _riz au lait_, rice puddings felt uniform and boring in every food culture. Spices were the only way to tell bowls of rice and milk apart. Cardamom and rosewater suggest _kheer_, cinnamon and nutmeg hint at _arroz con leche_, and unflavored is a sorry tribute to Nordic puddings in the Midwest.

I love riz au lait for its decadent custard base. Adding egg yolks, heavy cream and butter transforms a lean journeyman pudding into a paunchy contented retiree. A custard base makes a rice pudding more of an ice cream, allowing for an exploration of familiar accompaniments beyond seasoning.

Below is my current favorite take on riz au lait. I pair it with  a rose-flavored raspberry compote that is inspired by the [Ispahan macaron](https://www.pierreherme.com/fr/ispahan-entremets.html). I serve them at the end of my in-laws' Swedish-inspired Christmas Eve feast.

## Ingredients and notes
**Serves 8 to 12**
### Rice pudding
I adapted from Bruno Albouze's riz au lait [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD3enxnS-JY), scaling for up to a dozen guests. Albouze also made a more indulgent [version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B190GFDpYto) with white chocolate and a crème brûlée-style crust. I highly recommend checking out both videos.

* 500ml water
* Pinch of salt
* 140g rice.
    * Albouze recommends Arborio rice for the 'dessert risotto' feel. I go with Basmati because I have it on hand and am more familiar with in kheer
* 1.2l whole milk
    * For a richer experience, I experimented with ratios of half-and-half and milk. While it's not a bad idea, the thicker cooking liquid makes it difficult to tell if the rice is cooking
* 10g vanilla paste
* 100g granulated sugar
    * Albouze's sugar amount may seem low to American cooks, but it really is the perfect amount. If anything, using a sweet sauces means one could further reduce sugar by 5%-10%. Reducing more than 10% may mean insufficient sugar for beating yolks
* 2 egg yolks
* 60g butter
    * Kerrygold or better, please!
* 250g whipped cream
    * Albouze says this is optional, which means the dessert would be incomplete without it

### Rose-raspberry compote
* 70g raspberry preserves
* 30ml hot water
* Pinch of salt
* 8g rosewater
    * Add more sparingly!
* Fresh raspberries
    * I eyeball this one

## Directions
### Rice pudding
Watch Albouze's rice pudding recipe, starting [here](https://youtu.be/cD3enxnS-JY?t=22). As with any rice pudding, in brief:

#### Parboil rice
* Boil water
* Add salt and rice to boiling water
* Cook for 3-4 minutes
* Strain

#### Make custard
* Get the milk and half of the sugar to boil
* Add rice and cook on low heat for about 25 minutes. Stir every now and then
* Beat egg yolks with the rest of the sugar
* Addd yolk mixture into the rice
* Cook for 2-3 minutes more
* Off the heat, mix in the butter. Also mix in the vanilla paste
* Store in a container, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least a few hours

#### Assembly
* Whip cream to soft peaks
* Remove plastic wrap off of custard and loosen it by whipping it
* Fold in the whipped cream before serving. Adding in the whipped cream more than a few hours in advance may result in a 'dry' rice pudding where the cream has dried out.

### Rose-raspberry compote

* Mix hot water in small increments with preserves into a sauce of desired thinness
* Add in rosewater and salt to sauce
* Add in raspberries. If desired, mash a few for more of a compote-like consistency
* Chill the compote
