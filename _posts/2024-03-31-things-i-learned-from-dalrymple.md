##  The East India Company was a public for-profit corporation that ruled India for 100 years before being nationalized

The 'Raj' officially starts in the mid-1800s because that is when the [British government takes over the company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1858) and turns India into a traditional colony ruled by an overseas state power. From its founding in 1600 up to 1858, the company had the charter to raise armies and govern in the subcontinent as part of its operating activities. I was not aware of the distinction between Company rule and Crown rule before reading this book.

Why does it matter to know that the first half of British rule was private and not by the government? It's not like it would have made exploitation any less so.

That a foreign private company, supported by its government, took over people abroad is a theme that is incredibly relevant for today.

- Skilled weavers who wove cotton into bafthawa, literally 'woven air'

## Mir Jafar wasn't the World's Worst Traitor and Siraj ud Daula wasn't some noble antihero

Clive fought the battle of Plassey because the Jagat Seths promised him and the Company a great deal of money. This is because Siraj ud Daula was, by all accounts, a cruel and capricious feudal lord. Mir Jafar saw the
