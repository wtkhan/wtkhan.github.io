Why are there multiple places in Dhaka with better, cheaper (both at nominal exchange rates and after adjusting for purchasing power) croissants than just one bakery in Atlanta? In fact, why aren't there just more bakeries in Atlanta?

The likely answer to these questions is that demand factors are different in the two markets. These factors are: the addressable market density, supermarkets as a source of competitive substitutes and consumer tastes.

* Addressable market density
    * Dhaka is the seventh-most densely populated city in the world. (Kolkata is the fifth on that list, why can't Bengalis not be densely packed?)
* Supermarkets

* Consumer tastes
