Why are there multiple places in Dhaka with better, cheaper (both at nominal exchange rates and after adjusting for purchasing power) croissants than just one bakery in Atlanta? In fact, why aren't there just more bakeries in Atlanta?

The likely answer is that demand factors are different in the two markets. These factors are: the addressable market size, supermarkets as a source of competitive substitutes and consumer tastes.
