## Outline

* Happy that this museum with this specialist focus even exists in the Western world. I am interested in Islamic history because I consider it part of my personal history.
* The museum showcases how Islam and Islamic arts are shaped by people, their cultural heritage and contemporary events.
* TODO Toronto has a large share of Nizari Ismaili Muslims, which explains why the Aga Khan IV built his museum there
* Gift shop was fantastic
* Saw somebody painting a carved wooden frieze into a sketchbook. Inspired me to look into museum sketching (TODO add links) and bring supplies to a similar museum next time.
* Rotating contemporary arts exhibition demoed on the second floor
* Felt that the exhibit was concentrated in Iran and Turkey, and the medieval period aka the Golden Age of the Gunpowder Empires
    - Turns out they do have a lot of Mughal India stuff in their collections, just wasn't on display
* Things I'd have liked to see more of:
    - India stuff: Mughal-era fine jewelry and architecture
    - 3D reconstructions (digital or analog) of Islamic architecture. Given what felt like a focus on Safavid Persia, I'd have liked to see historically faithful model of Isfahan, perhaps a detailed one of [Naqsh-e-Jahan square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Jahan_Square).

[_Shell with inscriptions - India, 18th century AD - Incised mother of pearl_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/shell-inscriptions-akm665)
- > This palm-size, perfectly shaped mother-of-pearl shell displays an elegant design and an intriguing function. Its luminous surface is engraved with eight concentric rings containing verses from the Qur’an and religious supplications. The variety of the calligraphic styles and their layout make the design both dynamic and quite dignified. Although the intensity of the decorative program on the shell and the attention given to the minutest detail are unique, the shell may have been designed for a specific purpose that demonstrates how Muslims evoked the Qur’an in their everyday life. The concave shape of the shell and some of its decorative motifs suggest that it may have been used as a drinking vessel. In line with the belief in the protective and therapeutic power of the Qur’an, some Muslims drank water that came into direct contact with Qur’anic verses in order to obtain blessings and protection. Could this have been the role of this singular shell?

[_Astrolabe - Spain, 14th century AD - Bronze, engraved and inlaid with silver_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/planispheric-astrolabe-akm611)

[_Chest - Spain, 15th century AD - Wood_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/chest-akm634)
- >This scribe’s wooden cabinet is a rare survival and an extraordinary example of luxury woodwork production in Spain under the Nasrids (1232-1492). The tradition of inlaying walnut dates back to the Umayyad period in Spain (756-1031), and may be seen in extant mosque minbars (pulpits), doors and a variety of objects. The hallmarks of Nasrid era woodwork include elaborate inlays of ivory, bone, metal, wood and mother-of-pearl. The decorative programme of this cabinet includes large eight-pointed stars formed from interlocking squares; these motifs appear on many of the extant Nasrid wooden pieces in Granada museums and at the Alhambra. The cabinet contains a lidded interior compartment which probably contained writing implements.

[_Isfandiyar kills the Simurgh - Iran, 16th century AD - Opaque watercolour, gold, silver and ink on paper_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/isfandiyar-kills-the-simurgh-akm103)
- >The miniature painting “Isfandiyar kills the Simurgh” is from a dispersed illustrated manuscript of the Shahnameh (Book of Kings), completed by the Persian poet Firdausi ca. 1010. Shah Ismail II (r. 1576–77) [1] commissioned the manuscript, following the examples of his grandfather, Ismail I, and father Shah Tahmasp, both of whom showed interest in Firdausi’s epic at one time during their reigns. Ismail II’s Shahnameh can be seen as a link in the chain of royal copies of the Book of Kings, after Shah Tahmasp’s spectacular manuscript and forming a bridge to the next period of royal patronage of the epic under Shah ‘Abbas (1587–1629). The manuscript was left unfinished upon Ismail II’s death. However, for a brief period, Ismail II’s atelier employed a number of artists who contributed to the illustration of the Shahnameh, including Siyavush, Sadiqi Beg, Naqdi, Murad Dailami and Mihrab. These artists did not sign their work, and attributions were probably made by the contemporary royal librarian. In its bottom left-hand corner, this painting is attributed to Siyavush.

Things I wish that were on display:

[_An aged pilgrim - India, 17th century AD - Opaque watercolour, gold, paper_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/aged-pilgrim-akm152)

[_Genealogical chart of Jahangir - India, 17th century AD - Opaque watercolour, ink, gold on paper_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/genealogical-chart-jahangir-akm151)

[_Portrait of Emperor Shah Jahan, his three sons, and Asaf Khan- India, 17th century AD - Opaque watercolour, ink, gold on paper_](https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/artifact/shah-jahan-his-three-sons-and-asaf-khan-akm124)


As you enter the museum building, the gift shop is the first thing you see to your left. I was totally captured by the aesthetics of the items on display. The decorative plates, pots and prints from Turkey were some of the most tasteful pieces I have seen in North America. The museum knew this too because it showed in the price tags. Nonetheless, I hadn't even seen the place yet and I knew it had made a big impression on my subconscious.

I enjoyed the [animated map of Islamic empires](https://www.instagram.com/agakhanmuseum/p/C9NhJNDiqpt/) throughout the world and over time. I am a self-aware sucker for world map visualizations. I feel that everything I need to know about a given topic is in a single frame of Earth. It's a completionist's dream to just focus on the plate in front of them. But of course, shapes on a map don't reveal the stories of the people who lived and experienced change and upheaval. Thankfully, that's what the rest of the museum is for.

I watched empires originate in the Arabian peninsula migrate across the sea to Iran and Central Asia, then make their ways through the Himalayas to the Gangetic plains and on to the Deccan. Separately, Islam also traveled by boat to the shores of Indonesia and East Africa. It is heavy to realize that Islam spread through conquest of land and people. I don't think any peace-loving Muslim wants to contend with that thought. This map is supposed to be the museum's exhibit A for its thesis that Islam and Islamic culture are not monoliths. There is a diversity of cultures and regional identities beyond the fundamentalism that's focused on in the West. I think this is an important argument in general about any major belief system.
