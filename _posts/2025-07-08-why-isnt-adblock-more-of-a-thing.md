Recently YouTube buffers videos on the web for browsers running ad blockers. This makes for a more frustrating user experience. It also marks the refinement of a strategy of alienating users from at least a year ago, when they began randomly showing users a banner saying 'Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube' ðŸ™„.

My hypothesis is that while ad blocker use has probably been a problem for YouTube forever, only recently have enough users sustainably moved to mobile. This means they can now focus on the ad-blocking holdouts on the web. These holdouts probably (and hopefully) number in the low millions at the least and are growing at some small rate, which warrants enough concern for YouTube to invest time and effort to go after us.

Thinking about the funnel, in descending order of control:
- Desktop web
    - Can access site with an ad/tracker blockers on or without signing in (though some content will be blocked). Both things make it difficult to track activity with granularity, which explains why they are doing what they are doing
- Mobile web, particularly for iOS
    - YouTube can control how videos are played on browsers like Safari, which allows them to do things like pause a video when the app is backgrounded or auto-mute and fake buffer when new videos are loaded
- Mobile/ TV app
    - YouTube can control more of the experience
    - Typically need a paid subscription to avoid ads, though Android has some jailbroken alternatives but these are probably less in use at the moment (the new adblocker on the Web)
