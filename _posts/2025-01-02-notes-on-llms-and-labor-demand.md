I discovered this [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4874104) by Scott Abrahams and Frank S. Levy, via a [Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/technology/ai-economy-workers.html) from a week ago.

The paper's central prediction is: companies will substitute LLMs for college grads → Demand for four-year degrees will fall → Fewer people will move to big cities, where the college-graduate jobs concentrate and instead choose to settle in smaller, cheaper cities → Political polarization between regions will fall as regional concentrations of college-educated workers fall.

What follows below are my reactions to reading the Times piece and the paper's abstract, conclusion and introduction sections.

## On the paper

After reading the abstract, I was skeptical of the paper's grand prediction. Predicting big changes in labor demand and migration due to LLMs is remarkable already, then extrapolating to shifts in political alignment is bold. I wouldn't react as much to that story if I read it in an op-ed, but it seemed like a big leap in a single research paper.

> Combining our mapping [of LLM impacts on labor demand] with [post-1980 US manufacturing decline effects on US employment] avenues, we predict that displaced college graduates will migrate towards smaller, lower exposure urban centers including Rochester, New York and Savannah, Georgia, that demand for a four-year college education will fall, and that the migration patterns and politics of affected persons will dampen rather than exacerbate political polarization [...]

The authors' comparison of LLM impacts on labor demand with the post-1980
US manufacturing decline effects is apples-to-oranges. When companies globalized, they moved factories from one region to cheaper ones. They didn't wholesale replace American workers with robots and somehow still retain domestic production, which is the extreme outcome we imagine with white-collar jobs and generative AI.

A comparison to Web-enabled automation would have been more apt. This would have shown how malemployment in the labor market would be an important immediate consequence of companies automating jobs and reducing headcount. Adopting the Web significantly reduced the need for dedicated back office personnel, travel agents, customer support, etc. But we were back on the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and demanding our admin costs be further minimized, travel be cheaper, and troubles be shot faster. SaaS companies profited by meeting this demand with building digital platforms and hiring people in contract roles with minimized pay and scope for college-educated workers. These firms also invested in small pools of engineering talent to build out the platforms. This shifted returns from specific majors to STEM, while the overall expected return from a college degree increased. As for shifts in labor migration or political polarization, I'd argue the Web didn't dissuade us moving to big cities for jobs and so we are only even more politically polarized.

The authors would probably respond that they want to leverage lessons of recent history of big impacts to a specific labor class and that Web adoption is still relatively new and things are in flux. I think the authors used the manufacturing decline data because it was available, but it's not the best analogue.

Regardless, they used the manufacturing decline framework to produce this map of exposure to LLM shocks, based on current concentrations of jobs that require college degrees or more. "Exposure" means an LLM can automate at least part of a worker's job, requiring fewer workers overall to produce a fixed amount of output.

This maps shows that the top 20% of exposure is for large urban centers (DC, LA, SF, NY) that (i) have lots of white-collar jobs requiring college degrees and (ii) vote Democrat. This is the basis for the authors' predictions above.

It's tough to fully buy the argument that the demand for college degrees will fall based on labor automation alone. LLMs, like the Web, won't replace credentialism in society and the signaling value of college degrees. Students will demand degrees to compete in the labor market, even if degrees are no longer the main selling point in their resumes.

In their conclusion, I appreciated the sobering reminder that LLM development is concentrated in the hands of a few powerful market players:

> Software companies have long argued that they can regulate themselves. There are reasons to be skeptical. In recent decades, many software technologies have tended toward a few dominant firms driven by network externalities. The dominant firms and their management became extremely wealthy as a result.
>
> AI software—in particular LLMs—reinforces this tendency toward dominant firms and concentrated money. Developing and training an LLM is extremely expensive both in terms of computational time and in data and power requirements. One result is that university researchers are priced out of developing this technology [...]. A second result is that the LLM industry is dominated by a few firms. [...] Given the firms’ economic power and the importance of money in current political life, the outcome of a government/industry contest is not easy to predict.

## An aside: on the Times article

The Times article was, at best, all over the place.

It is incredible how the piece begins with grim predictions (and no specific timeline) for the effects of LLM technology for college-educated workers. Then, it abruptly shifts focus to highlighting small businesses using LLM software. It features interviews with founders from two businesses in Chattanooga, TN and the mayor, and zero accounts from the workers who will be affected.

It's actually not clear how/why these businesses are featured in a story about LLM-enabled automation. One is a [truck parking services startup](https://truckparkingclub.com/). The CEO mentioned moving to Chattanooga to benefit from the trucking industry's agglomerative effects there. The [second](https://shappi.com/home) is a gig/marketplace app that connects buyers in South America to passengers in the US who will deliver their goods purchased in the US. They moved there because their investors asked them to do so. Both are planning to use chatbots to assist customer support reps. That's the extent of it!

The whole thing read as if the [Pulitzer-winning reporter](https://www.nytimes.com/by/steve-lohr) merged a fluff piece for the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce with an incomplete essay on automation and workers.

## Back to the paper

I know I criticized it a ton, but I like this paper for applying recent economic history to take a stab at the uncertain future and offer grand predictions. It's a refreshing break from studies that take 50 pages or more to exhaustively establish causal effects well after a major economic event. And I even enjoyed entertaining the possibility that LLM-induced migration would reduce job concentration and political polarization! I would like to live in a US where gaps in opportunities, amenities and politics between big and small cities decrease. But I have to temper my own excitement with the rest of the sobering story.

Before I read this paper, I expected that its prediction will be that adopting LLMs will continue what the post-2000 Web adoption started. I still expect this to happen. So to determine society's/economy's response to LLM disruption of white-collar jobs, we have to assess how we responded to Web disruption.

For now everybody agrees that LLMs, on some level or another, will change white-collar work. Big props to this paper, unlike the Times article, for raising valid concerns about the oligopoly in the development and distribution of LLMs. That the research behind the technology has also grown opaque makes it difficult for academics and other observers to predict how it will pan out.
