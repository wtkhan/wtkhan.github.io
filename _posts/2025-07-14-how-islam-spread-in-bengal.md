I read parts of [Richard M. Eaton's](https://history.arizona.edu/person/richard-eaton) [book](https://www.amazon.com/Frontier-1204-1760-Comparative-Studies-Societies/dp/0520205073?crid=V4JEORCQ6HV4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1jSQmFidLCANHQJLHlaVQg.s3bbszge8wYbeF9ybjiWwaP4BetNglO6O4zYbls4Hvw&dib_tag=se), "The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760" watched a couple of his presentations on the topic. My motivation was to better understand my ancestors than the slim details that my parents offer. When did they settle in the places that my parents call their hometowns? When did they become Muslims? Were they coerced into adopting Islam?

What follows are a summary of his research and follow-up questions:

## Islam came to western Bengal with Central Asian warlords
Islam formally arrived in the power centers of Bengal (today's West Bengali and some northwestern Bangladeshi areas) with the military conquests of Persianized military commanders moving into the subcontinent. These leaders were expanding their domains down the Gangetic plains and into the delta. Islamic values shaped their governance and political messaging, manifesting in:

* Building mosques, which for the first 200 years leaned towards Persian architecture before adopting vernacular Bengali styles from temples. The imams led their Friday congregations in praying for the wellbeing of the ruling leader and his dynasty
* Giving themselves titles that grew audacious over time with their regional independence, beginning with being the "right hand of the viceregent [Caliph] of God" to claiming being the new Caliph
* Inscribing the shahadah in Arabic in coins minted in Bengal

Here is a rough timeline of major events:

* **1203**: Bakhtiyar Khalji defeats Lakshman Sen and the Sen dynasty. The Turko-Afghan Muslim ruler takes over a great chunk of Bengal for his overlord, Muhammad Ghori. This establishes formal Muslim rule in the region.
* **1225**: The founder of the Delhi Sultanate, Shams ud-Din Iltutmish, dispatches troops to Bengal and takes it over from the Khalji dynasty. Bengal now becomes a province of the Delhi Sultanate
* For the next 125 years, the sultans of Delhi struggle to corral in rogue Muslim rulers of Bengal. In an attempt to simplify governance, Delhi splits Bengal into three administrative provinces. The Iran-born governor of South Bengal (in Satgaon), Ilyas Shah, declares independence from Delhi and unifies the three provinces into an independent Bengal Sultanate in 1352.
* **1529**: The various dynasties of the Bengali Sultanate shift their messaging strategies from Persian and Arab influences towards Bengali culture to better appease non-Muslim subjects. While Farsi and Arabic are still used in administration, Bangla achieves universality in the courts. Sultans adopt Bengali and Bengali Hindu cultural practices. Separately, the Mughals and the Afghan Sher Shah Suri take turns to chip away at the Hussain Shahi dynasty and the Bengal Sultanate falls. Under Akbar, in the mid 1500s, Bengal becomes a province of the Mughal empire.

A small aside: reflecting on the medieval history of Bengal makes me appreciate the enduring soft power of Persian culture in my life today. In Dhaka, my family lives in the Mirpur area. The name translates to 'land of the prince' in Farsi. We say goodbye with 'Khoda Hafez'. My maternal grandfather learned Farsi in school in British Bengal. (I think that was the only foreign language curriculum available.)

These battles and power struggles occured in the western part of Bengal, which is mostly Indian territory today. Up until the time of Akbar, eastern Bengal was densely forested and sparsely populated. The indigenous people of eastern Bengal had not yet adopted formal religions like Hinduism and Islam at scale. At this time, they had animist folk traditions and practices.

## Political and geographical factors interacted to expand Islam's reach into eastern Bengal

Before going into this book, I assumed Islam spread in premodern Bangladesh through a combination of the sword and migration from North India. Now I know this may not entirely be the case. One of Eaton's contributions with this book is to show that one of the largest ethnic groups did not become Muslims through conventional violent means. Eastern Bengal was far from big cities and other clusters of regional power that it wasn't an important place for rulers to convert locals en masse or incentivize foreigners to migrate and settle.

Eaton explains it was the Mughal conquest of Bengal that incidentally brought Islam to the eastern half. The Mughals only cared about three things: stability, loyalty and revenue. Like other conquerors before them, imposing Islam wasn't a priority in itself, rather a means to governance. Their land grants stipulated that holders must build places of worship where the locals can pray for the longevity of the empire. Since land grand recipients could be either Muslim or Hindu, these places of worship could be mosques or temples. Eaton's original research of Persian land grants from customs offices in Bangladesh's districts shows illustrations for structures made of thatch and clay as places of worship. This means that mosques were radically different in architecture and stature than the Persian-inspired mosques of north India. This established the first Muslim leaders or Sufi pirs going into the eastern hinterlands as pioneers with a religious mandate.

Muslim leaders spread the word of Islam in Bangla using the Arab-Persian technologies of pen and paper. There were exegeses and commentaries like the [Nabi Bangsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Sultan) (stories of the Prophets) for newly converted Muslims to better understand the characters mentioned in the Quran.

By pure coincidence, as Akbar began issuing land grants for expansion into eastern Bengal, the Ganga river had finished migrating eastwards. In the span of centuries, the Ganga diverted from its Satgaon delta and emptying into the eastern half of the delta. This rerouted fertile silt deposits to the hinterland, which was good news for farming settlers. This also made it possible for a ruling power to, for the first time in history, control the trading route from Delhi to Bengal.

## In eastern Bengal, Islam was the religion of the plow, not the sword

As Islam spread into the newly settled eastern Bengal areas, it took on a distinct agrarian identity. While imposed by elites in Delhi via land grants, Islam was not considered a Central Asian import. Instead, it became the religion of cultivators. Islam became one component of the eastern Bengali settler's identity.

The local leaders in Bengal in the thirteenth century onwards were _not_ sultans, emperors or their administrators, but the Sufis who ventured into the land. They were the spiritual kings who performed miracles (start agriculture) and would intercede for mercy in the afterlife with Allah for them.

This last part was surprising to me. Perhaps being a city slicker my whole life, I didn't know that there was an agrarian element to Bengali Muslim identity. My parents have nostalgic memories of visiting their grandparents' farms on holidays, and those aren't tinged with religion either.

## Outstanding questions

* Islam spread by the sword in Bengal and it settled in the region by localizing to the natives' cultural practices. In that initial settling period, was it still violent? Were there ramifications for natives who wanted to cultivate but refused to participate in mosques?
    * Ideal primary sources: Contemporaneous accounts from literate Hindus and other non-Muslims, land or wealth distributions in the area over time

* When did Muslims in eastern Bengal move away from Persian-derived Sufi mysticism and towards an Arabesque austere Islam? Is the rise of Saudi-funded madrassas a cause or symptom?

* Do we know how the Mughals distributed land grants? Given the spread of Islam, it was probably not a 50/50 random split between Hindus and Muslims and instead Mughals had a preference to granting permission to Mughal-allied Muslims
    * Ideal primary sources: Correspondence showing how land grants were distributed in South Asia in general and in Bengal in particular

* We learn that pioneers would clear a plot of land with their followers first and then seek permission from the Mughal regional administration to cultivate it. What was so appealing about the unsettled swampy forests of eastern Bengal to these people? Were these opportunists like pioneers in other rushes?
    * Ideal primary sources: Personal accounts from pioneers to better understand their motivations
