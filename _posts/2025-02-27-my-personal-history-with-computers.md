We met my wife's grandfather for dinner. He was an electrical engineer. When I hear his stories of obsessing over model trains and amateur radio as a child, it's easy to see how he chose that profession. Grandpa turned to personal computing in the late 80s and has been an Apple true believer since. Today, he rocks an Apple Watch, loves his iPad and uses a DIY iMac with an M1 Mini fixed to the back of a third-party monitor.

Hearing about Grandpa's relationship with technology throughout his life made me consider mine. As a child, I was more fearful than curious about using computers. I worried about bricking our home desktop that we ran for 11 years. Over time, with some encouragement from my mother, I grew more confident. Towards the end of college, I began programming and approached my laptop as something more than a communications device. Around this time I also began thinking about 'computers' beyond the appliance on a desk and in more abstract terms of human networks, corporate ownership of the cloud, politics, etc. Now that I work in the technology sector in a software engineering-adjacent profession, it's to work and think about things I would be doing anyways. Outside of work, I approach new and shiny things in technology with guarded optimism. I am looking for creatively fulfilling activities in the real world so I can have a healthier time in front of screens for the rest of my working life.

My earliest memories of using computers may be learning to type in school. Unfortunately, the whole home row positioning never came to me. I think whatever hand-eye coordination issues I may have had growing up held me back. While I don't peck at letters today, a typing expert would have feedback for my lopsided touch typing and hand positioning.

It was difficult to wrap my mind around non-typing software. I preferred watching TV and playing with toys. I wasn't spending hours on Paint, Minesweeper or Solitaire. Maybe it's better if somebody shows a kid how these applications work because it's not easy to intuit otherwise. I thought I liked Paintball, but I was mashing the spacebar the whole time. Maybe it was the clunkiness of PCs of that era: boot, wait for the BIOS beep, log in, wait, click Start, click application, smell the weird hot fan air the whole time, click some more, exit, click Start to shut down. With TVs, you just turn them on and collapse on the sofa. I was and remain religiously lazy.

My dad brought home our first PC and the desk with the pullout keyboard tray some time in June 2001. It came with Windows Me installed. He had bought a dialup Internet connection too. This machine would go on to be the source of everybody's rage before we finally upgraded more than a decade later. For a while, he was the exclusive operator in the house. His usage set the tone for the rest of us. A PC was a place to write emails to relatives or documents for work. He had Skype and an obnoxious headset. Neither ever worked. We were still cramming into the payphone booth across the street to make expensive calls overseas to my grandmother.

I began using the Web purely to consume and window shop. I loved reading Archie comics and watching Cartoon Network, so I would go to their respective websites to look at the pretty pictures. Each session, I loaded up shopping carts with merch, fully knowing that I can't buy them (let alone ship to Bangkok from the United States).

Even as an adolescent, my use of computers wasn't exciting. I didn't take to video games, so the motivation to switching to the latest hardware was absent. I mostly used our ancient machine to read and write documents, chats and emails. I flired with art projects on (old versions of) Photoshop and Illustrator. I liked them for making graphics to the written word. I am not trying to say that I am a writer by nature. It's more like I viewed a computer as a pair of pen with infinite ink and a notebook with neverending paper. The thought of using this pen and notebook to do anything more than write letters never occurred.

When I was 14, my mother enrolled me in a PC hardware technician course. She saw it advertised in the newspaper. It was meant for young adults (really, men) who are looking to enter a new, emerging trade in Bangladesh. She saw owning a PC was similar to owning a car and wanted for me to have the ability to independently troubleshoot issues. I am grateful she made me do this. The course made me more confident with using computers. A full reinstall of pirated Windows turned out to be the answer for a variety of software problems. It set the stage for approaching computers later in life with courage and confidence.

My first text-based programming experience was in college with Stata, when I had to learn commands to ingest and analyze data. Stata is proprietary software. Its syntax has a superficial resemblance to Unix command line tools, minus the pipes. Limited programming abstractions (no arrays or hashmaps, for example) means there are only so many ways to achieve a given task. This was a blessing and a curse: it was a great learning language and development environment. But I also had terrible programming hygiene. I ran code interactively, one manually input line at a time. I was terrified of running whole scripts at once because I was scared that the outputs would change between runs otherwise. Over time and with help from research mentors, I improved my development practices.

While R was free, I never took to it because I hated the syntax and the noisy interpreter messages. Never mind that all serious statistical programming work was happening in R. I was intimidated by it and turned to Stata and the online user community.
