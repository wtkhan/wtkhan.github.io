I love *riz au lait* for its decadent custard base. Adding egg yolks, heavy cream and butter transforms a lean journeyman pudding into a paunchy contented retiree. A custard base makes a rice pudding more of an ice cream, allowing for an exploration of familiar accompaniments beyond seasoning.

Below is my current favorite take on riz au lait. I pair it with  a rose-flavored raspberry compote that is inspired by the [Ispahan macaron](https://www.pierreherme.com/fr/ispahan-entremets.html). I serve them at the end of my in-laws' Swedish Christmas Eve feast.

## Ingredients and notes
**Serves 8 to 12**
### Rice pudding
I adapted from Bruno Albouze's riz au lait [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD3enxnS-JY), scaling for up to a dozen guests. Albouze also made a more indulgent [version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B190GFDpYto) with white chocolate and a crème brûlée-style crust. I highly recommend checking out both videos.

* 500ml water
* Pinch of salt
* 140g rice
    * Albouze recommends Arborio rice for the risotto-like mouthfeel. I go with Basmati because I have it on hand and am more familiar with it in kheer
* 1.2l whole milk
    * I’ve experimented with substituting 50% of the milk for half-and-half. This makes a richer and thicker pudding, but it makes the rice's cooking harder to judge. Stick with whole milk for a smoother experience
* 10g vanilla paste
* 100g granulated sugar
    * Albouze's sugar amount may seem low to American cooks, but it really is the perfect amount. If anything, pairing with a raspberry sauce means one could further reduce sugar by 5%-10%. Reducing any more may mean insufficient sugar for beating yolks
* 2 egg yolks
* 60g butter
    * Kerrygold or better, please!
* 250g whipped cream
    * If you go for the 50/50 milk and half-and-half route above, the whipped cream becomes necessary to lighten up the thick rice pudding base

### Rose-raspberry compote
* 70g raspberry preserves
* 30ml hot water
* Pinch of salt
* 8g rosewater
    * Add more sparingly!
* Fresh raspberries
    * I eyeball this one

## Directions
### Rice pudding
Watch Albouze's rice pudding recipe, starting [here](https://youtu.be/cD3enxnS-JY?t=22). As with any rice pudding, in brief:

#### Parboil rice
This technique makes sense for removing excess starch from varieties like Arborio. I am not sure if we need this for Basmati and similar, but it does not hurt the final product.

* Boil water
* Add salt and rice to boiling water
* Cook for 3-4 minutes
* Strain

#### Make custard
* Heat the milk and half of the sugar until boiling.
* Add the rice and cook on low for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Beat the egg yolks with the remaining sugar, then stir them into the rice. Cook for 2-3 more minutes.
* Off the heat, mix in the butter and vanilla paste.
* Transfer to a container, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for at least a few hours.

#### Assembly
* If using it, whip the cream to soft peaks
* Remove plastic wrap off of custard and loosen it by whipping it
* Fold in the whipped cream before serving. Avoid folding it in too far in advance. Otherwise, the pudding might dry out.

### Rose-raspberry compote

* Mix the raspberry preserves with hot water until you reach your desired sauce consistency.
* Stir in the rosewater and salt
* Add fresh raspberries (and mash a few if you prefer a chunkier compote)
* Chill for an hour or two before serving.
