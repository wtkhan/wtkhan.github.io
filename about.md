## About Dirty Chai

This site is called 'Dirty Chai' because, like its owner, the name sounds Indian&mdash; but [isn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_chai#dirty_chai). More seriously, Dirty Chai is a grab bag of topics I love to chat about like food, economics and technology. John Gruber and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) inspired me to build a home on the web and give it a whimsical name.

Thanks for visiting!

## About Wahid

I enjoy working as a product data scientist at [Doximity](doximity.com), a networking platform for clinicians. Before this, I trained and worked in economics and public policy. If interested, my [resume]() has professional details.
